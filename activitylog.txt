- Developed a rough plan and submitted proposal
- Spent 1 hr at home uploading a bird list and writing code to sort by length
- Spent some time sorting through list for most common birds.

03/24/2022
- 30 minutes coding to choose a bird from the list,
- 30 minutes coding a CLI for guessBird()

03/29/2022
In class - spent 1 hr learning about GUI
At study - 1 hr testing and adding finer details to BirdleGame - validGuess(), cheat code, etc. 
At home - Spent 1 hr at home making the BirdleAlphabet class so that there's a QWERTY display of spaced-out letter buttons

04/10/2022
- At home - spent more than 1hr reworking the GUI, Alphabet, and Game files
- Now the Alphabet can pass information to the Game and back

04/13/2022
In class - spent the hour working on the Display class, adding in buttons

05/09/2022
In class - played around with BirdleDisplay, making it so that a grid was displayed

05/10/2022
In class (1hr) and out of class (1hr)
- Finished BirdleDisplay so that the GridLayout worked
- Edited BirdleAlphabet so it has a private BirdleDisplay that stores information
- Made it so the BirdleDisplay takes in information from BirdleAlphabet about the word and whether it was correct
- but not yet able to display that information. 
- Lots of progress today

05/12/2022
- In class (1 hr) - editing BirdleDisplay display function
- Updates the game whenever a guess is made, not complete yet but getting there
- Still need to integrate BirdleGUI to have a JPanel that responds to change from the BirdleDisplay class.

05/13/2022
- In class (1 hr) - removing BirdleGUI so that BirdleAlphabet carried out its functions
- Adding spacing in the BirdleDisplay grid, fixing some bugs with the char[][] arrays
Out of class (1 hr) - finishing up the code so that it runs perfectly from the command line
- Now I need to figure out how to edit a JPanel that's already added to the frame, and then it would be a working demo
- GOT A WORKING DEMO

05/23/2022
- 1 hr in class plus 1 hour outside of class reworking BirdleAlphabet get() method to be more efficient
- HOLY HECK IT WORKS WITH CHANGING THE WORD SIZE

06/01/2022
- Made a second list of passable 5 letter words; guesses can be from that list but not the chosen word
- Plurals of four letter birds can be guessed
- started implementing radio buttons to choose between 5-letter-mode and hard mode

06/05/2022
- Radio buttons correctly work now in terms of calling the right Birdle frame up, but birdle isn't displaying... will fix that bug later
- Spent like 4 hours making the keyboard also control the buttons, same as from the on-screen buttons (had to learn how to use InputMap and ActionMap)
- Also fixed the way the display panel was rendered so that it wasn't deleting everything and readding it every time a button was clicked

06/06/2022
- IDs yellow and green correctly now - 1hr
- Manually edit all bird list so that it includes plurals, took out hard birds- a bit less than an hour

06/08/2022
- 1.5 to 2 hrs making keyboard letter color change so that it reflects letter correctness

06/09/2022
- In class - fixed bug of when incorrect and press "delete", everything gets deleted

06/11/2022 (sat)
- 30 mins - fixed bug of last guess not changing color on display because of out of bounds error
